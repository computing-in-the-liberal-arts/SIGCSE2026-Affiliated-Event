# Birds of a Feather (BoF) Session

Materials from the [SIGCSE 2025 Affiliated event](https://computing-in-the-liberal-arts.github.io/SIGCSE2025-Affiliated-Event/) are on the main page. This page is for notes from a related activity at SIGCSE 2025.  

Consolidated notes for the Bof Session entitled: Computing Education in Liberal Arts Colleges

### General notes:

- Job posting and an existing github repository linked. Can the committee get involved, promote, etc., or otherwise better call out and give attention to liberal arts related job postings.
- The semantics of naming ethics courses was discussed. One attending mentioned that he doesn't even call it ethics when embedding into courses but talked about phrasing it to student about looking at unintended consequences and such.

### Breakout notes - Interdisciplinary Group:

- Interdisciplinary seems to be the place to "flex our muscles" when it comes to disciplines that should be involved with or integrated into every other discipline. "Our time to shine" was another great phrase that came out of that portion of the discussion.
- Our departments are often smaller, so potentially less silo'ed, if we make the effort.
- We "think" we are interdisciplinary, but our non-CS colleagues might not agree.
  - *Jake found this comment very interesting - perception can be reality, so the concept expressed here is likely worth exploring in some context. Dovetails into explaining to non-CS folk "what it is that we do."*
- Smaller school departments might need to improve outreach to survive.
- Discussion on courses for non-majors.
- Models of successful interdisciplinary courses identified as a need.
  - Collecting them somewhere.
  - Examples of successes (and failures)
  - Environmental or institutional influences on successful efforts *(Jake addition - how can administrative support, reasonably, efforts in this area?)*
- Does it always need to be a ***new*** class? (Interesting observation from an attendee - most of the conversation was around new courses, but did it always need to be a new class that integrates another disc)
