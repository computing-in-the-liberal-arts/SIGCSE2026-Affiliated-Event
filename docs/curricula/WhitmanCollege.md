## Institutional and Departmental Context
- Location: Walla Walla, WA
- Undergraduate student body size: ~1500 students
- Degree(s) offered: BA
- Department/major name: Computer Science
- Number of contributing faculty: ~5 FTE
- Number of majors annually: 15-20 majors
- Does the department offer any graduate programs? No
- Other context: Whitman's computer science major is less than ten years old, first appearing in the catalog for the 2017-18 academic year. The existing curriculum was designed to emphasize CS as a rigorous and distinct academic discipline and to be taught by only three full-time faculty on a 3-2 teaching load.

## Description of Curricular Innovation

Our innovation is in an innovation of _process_. Whitman College is the first institution to design a computer science curriculum based on the 
[Curricular Practices Workbook](https://computing-in-the-liberal-arts.github.io/CS2023/) under development by the 
[SIGCSE Committee on Computing Education in Liberal Arts Colleges](https://computing-in-the-liberal-arts.github.io/). We demonstrate one possible method for embedding this workbook within a collaborative, iterative process that emphasizes deliberation and shared decision-making.

Whitman's current CS program was designed for the inaugural Computer Science major in the mid-2010's, and by the early 2020's it was clear that both the faculty and the students had outgrown the existing curriculum. 

We planned our curricular revision around a week-long workshop in the summer of 2024, 
supported by an internal institutional grant for pedagogical development and facilitated 
by Andrea Tartaro, a co-author of the [Curricular Practices Workbook](https://computing-in-the-liberal-arts.github.io/CS2023/). 
A core premise of the Workbook is that curriculum design should be closely 
informed by institutional values, mission, and identity. 
Before the workshop, we collected various resources that captured that institutional 
context, including the college's current mission statements, notes from several years 
of senior exit interviews, and individual reflections on our aspirations for the 
educational experiences and outcomes we wanted for our students.
We also mapped our current current curriculum according to the Knowledge Areas of the [ACM 2023 Curricular Guidelines (CS2023)](https://csed.acm.org/cs2023-report-with-feedback/).

During the workshop itself, we developed our goals for our new curriculum in a few steps over several days of 
advance readings, individual homework, and discussion.
Guided by the Workbook and our facilitator, our discussions focused on these seven steps:

0. We established ground rules for collaboration, discussion, and decision making;
1. We articulated an aspirational identity statement for our program;
2. We documented design principles to be used in crafting a program according to our stated values;
3. We drafted program-level learning outcomes;
4. We mapped our learning outcomes to the [CS 2023](https://csed.acm.org/cs2023-report-with-feedback/) Knowledge Areas and identified program "Competency Areas";
5. We reflected on our current program to identify areas of alignment and misalignment to our developing program vision;
6. We ideated curricular innovations that could address new program vision.
   
Step 0 was not part of the Workbook but required by our administration as a condition of funding an external facilitator. Yet we found this step to be crucial, and in fact have adopted processes established during the workshop into ongoing departmental decision-making, for example [fist-to-five consensus-building](https://web.archive.org/web/20150219150200/http://www.freechild.org/Firestarter/Fist2Five.htm).

Each CS faculty member had a separate copy of the workbook that we used to do each activity individually, allowing us to develop and articulate ideas on our own. We then synthesized our individual responses into a shared department workbook, engaging in a process of  deliberation and negotiation through co-writing and co-editing. Our facilitator helped us recognize when our collective response was "good enough" to move on to the next step. Additionally, we participated in several collaborative design activities, for example, brainstorming structural contraints on sticky notes and clustering them into themes, which we then prioritized into a set of design principles.

By the end of the workshop, we had identified several key goals that would require curricular revision to achieve, such as:

* Redesign some core courses to require _no_ prerequisites in order to broaden entry points into the major, and increase points of engagement for nonmajors and opportunities for in-class discussions of social and ethical topics.
* Reduce the number of non-elective requirements to enable more opportunity for student choice in electives.
* Intentionally develop students' abilities to acquire skills progressively and independently to prepare them for capstone and lifelong learning after graduation.

During the fall semester, we met roughly weekly to work through the details of a revised curriculum, 
equipped with our notes from the workshop and the continued support of an interested faculty member 
from Whitman's Mathematics and Statistics Department as our new extra-departmental facilitator. 
Going beyond the content of the [Curricular Practices Workbook](https://computing-in-the-liberal-arts.github.io/CS2023/), 
the following process emerged:

1. We presented individually imagined curricula to capture and expand on various ideas for how we might carry out our program vision;
2. We identified common themes and specific new courses for further development;
3. We discussed new and revised courses and their mapping to the CS2023 Knowledge Areas;
4. We synthesized new major requirements, including reevaluation of alignment to program vision, learning outcomes, and design principles from the summer workshop;
5. We developed a curriculum transition plan along with formal course and program proposals.

Our resulting curriculum includes substantial changes, including reducing the number of directly required courses from 10 to 7, encouraging students to venture more deeply 
into a core area of computer science (systems, theory, or design), and offering new 100-level courses in discrete mathematics and computer systems & society. 
We believe that the added space for electives better deals with balancing ACM topic coverage with the expertise of our approximately 5 FTE faculty, allows for further program growth, and student freedom to explore and engage with the liberal arts and interdisciplinary programs.

At time of writing, our proposals are moving through institutional approval processes.
We still need to document our further reflections on our use of the Curricular Practices Workbook and
establish methods of assessment for our new program learning outcomes.
Our curricular changes will be incrementally rolled out over the next several years, 
beginning with the lowest level courses, while we teach out the upper level courses 
of our current curriculum for currently declared majors. 

## Challenges/Limitations

Whitman's curriculum was designed for Whitman: 
our faculty, our student population, and our institutional context. 
Rather than adopting our curriculum, we recommend using the process laid out in the [Curricular Practices Workbook](https://computing-in-the-liberal-arts.github.io/CS2023/). 

Our process benefited from two facilitators external to our department: 
for the summer workshop, a Workbook co-author, 
and for the fall working group, a Math colleague interested in curricular reform.
We initially wanted an external facilitator so that faculty members could focus on the curriculum redesign activities rather than the mechanics of facilitation. Ultimately, we found that having an outside perspective mitigated the dynamics of seniority and catalyzed us to explain--and thus reconsider--our existing department norms. 

The curricular revision process required a significant time investment from each of us:
20 hours of summer workshop meetings, 10 hours of fall working group meetings, and about as many hours of individual work.

We hesitated to make weighty decisions about our curriculum while one of our five tenure lines remains unfilled.
However, we believe that our revised curriculum will let all current faculty contribute to most (if not all) required courses,
while also making more space for each of us to contribute our unique expertise.
We are hopeful that our revised curriculum will accommate new colleagues with minimal adaptations.
