## Description of Curricular Innovation

As data collection and processing have become more central to a wide range of industries and, in many ways, to everyday life, the field of Data Science has emerged as the primary way of teaching students to engage intelligently with data and modeling, essential skills for life in the 21st century. Last Spring, the Computing & Information Studies department at W&J launched an interdisciplinary Data Science minor. Core classes are taught in the CIS department, and students are encouraged to take electives from a wide range of courses in other departments that introduce them to working with data in specific domain contexts. W&J already offers a Data Science Major Emphasis as part of the CIS department, having long acknowledged that data science is a core element of computing and information education. At a small college with a relatively low number of CIS majors (and an even smaller amount who choose to pursue the DS emphasis), we often have students from a variety of majors trying out our introductory-level data science courses and finding that they can complete analysis projects on topics relevant to their existing major. As an interdisciplinary minor that includes electives from many other disciplines, there is potential for effective overlap between the minor and a studentâ€™s major, which may be helpful as students complete our College's two courses of study requirement. Programs in data science or data analytics have been a major curricular trend of the past ten years, with many institutions starting or enhancing data science programs as part of Computing, Statistics, or Information Studies offerings. Having a Data Science minor as well as a major is increasingly seen as a way to engage more students in this growing field. Our minor has many of the same features as DS minors at other institutions: introductions to data organization, programming, and statistical modeling, a required statistics course, and detailed experience working with applied data in specific domains. But its interdisciplinary focus reflects the overall approach of the CIS department as well as the educational ethos of our small liberal arts college. Because we are each originally from fields outside of Data Science---English literature and Physics, respectively---the program also allows us to bring our interdisciplinary educational perspective on the field to our colleagues and students.

## Challenges/Limitations

The program is very young (this is its first year), and we have yet to see how our plans will have to be adjusted as the program grows. One current challenge is continuing to coordinate and accommodate faculty from a large number of disciplines---Chemistry, Biology, Business, Economics, Mathematics, Political Science, Philosophy, Physics, Psychology, and potentially more. As new courses that employ data science are offered and others are phased out, it's a challenge to make sure that the minor reflects all of the options available to students. Another challenge is helping students to see that a data science minor can enhance the study of *any* discipline, not just the ones currently offering electives or ones that students already view as "data-driven." We are also looking for ways to extend the minor's curriculum to instill in students a better understanding of the ways that quantitative and qualitative analysis complement each other.
