# Innovations and Opportunities<br>in Liberal Arts Computing Education

A [SIGCSE 2025](https://sigcse2025.sigcse.org) affiliated event organized by members of the [SIGCSE Committee on Computing Education in Liberal Arts Colleges](https://computing-in-the-liberal-arts.github.io/computing-in-the-liberal-arts/).

This event builds on directions and priorities identified at our prior SIGCSE events:
- [SIGCSE 2020 Pre-Symposium event](https://computing-in-the-liberal-arts.github.io/SIGCSE2020-PreSymposium-Event/)
- [SIGCSE 2021 Pre-Symposium event](https://computing-in-the-liberal-arts.github.io/SIGCSE2021-PreSymposium-Event/)
- [SIGCSE 2022 Affiliated event](https://computing-in-the-liberal-arts.github.io/SIGCSE2022-Affiliated-Event/)
- [SIGCSE 2023 Affiliated event](https://computing-in-the-liberal-arts.github.io/SIGCSE2023-Affiliated-Event/)
- [SIGCSE 2024 Affiliated Event](https://computing-in-the-liberal-arts.github.io/SIGCSE2024-Affiliated-Event/)

This event will include a morning session focused on topics covering the breadth of opportunities and challenges faced by liberal arts computing educators. An afternoon session will focus on the ACM/IEEE/AAAI CS2023 draft curriculum model. Members of the Committee will lead a workshop based on a liberal-arts focused process they have developed for curriculum review and revision that balances institutional identity with external guidelines for CS curricula. Feedback from this session will inform both the process under development and the Committee’s advocacy efforts with the ACM/IEEE/AAAI curriculum task force. Throughout the event, sessions will give participants an opportunity to learn about work already taking place within the liberal arts computing community as well as to engage in Q&A and breakout discussions.

## Invitation for Submissions and Participation

**Join us Wednesday, February 26th, 2025, for this SIGCSE pre-symposium event!**

This full-day event will promote connection and collaboration within the liberal arts computing community. It will be split into a morning session of panels and an afternoon unconference session. **Submissions are invited for both sessions.**

Submissions are not required to attend; all interested faculty and students are welcome. Registration will be through the SIGCSE Technical Symposium registration system with no additional fee to attend.

The morning session will focus on topics covering the breadth of opportunities and challenges faced by liberal arts computing educators. These topics may include innovative courses, curricula, co-curricular programs, DEI initiatives, academic and career advising, faculty recruiting and retention, and other issues as identified to have a specific liberal arts perspective. Selected submissions will be presented, with additional opportunities for discussion in breakout sessions.

The afternoon session will be held in an “unconference” format, with proposals accepted for working group topics from the community as a whole. This will allow the community time to connect and collaborate on projects of shared interest. Participants will select between topics within this session, which can be organized in a workshop, working group, or discussion group style. Examples of possible topics are provided below, but we welcome any proposal that may be of interest to liberal arts computing educators.

Throughout the event, sessions will give participants an opportunity to learn about work already taking place within the liberal arts computing community as well as to engage in Q&A and breakout discussions. Opportunities for networking with others in the liberal arts CS community will be emphasized.

- **Invitation for Submissions**

  **Morning Session: Innovations, Opportunities, and Challenges**

  The program committee invites submissions for presentations on any topic in computing education with a particular focus on liberal arts perspectives and approaches. Templates are provided to propose either an **effective innovation** or an exploration of a **unique opportunity or challenge** faced by the liberal arts computing education community. Submitters should select the template that works best for them. Possible topics might include innovative courses, curricula, or co-curricular programs, DEI initiatives, academic and career advising, faculty recruiting and retention, and other issues as identified to have a specific liberal arts perspective. Selected submissions will be briefly presented, roughly 10-15 minutes each. Breakout sessions, led by panelists and program committee members, will then be used to allow attendees to discuss these topics in small groups with the presenter and other interested attendees.

  Submissions should follow the templates provided below. The program committee will lightly screen all submissions for suitability. All suitable submissions will be made available to the community through the Committee site, and all authors of accepted submissions will receive an invitation to participate in the event.

  **Afternoon Session: Unconference on Liberal Arts CS Education**

  The program committee invites proposals to lead groups during the afternoon “unconference”. Proposals should describe the topic, desired outcomes or products from the session, and a format for organizing the discussion or collaborative work (e.g., workshop, working group, discussion group). Possible topics may include but are not limited to the role of CS faculty in coordinating computing across an institution, identifying a focused “liberal arts” CS core out of the larger CS2023 core, community efforts to advocate for the value of CS education research within tenure and promotion review, and course-specific topics such as implementing specifications grading or implementing inclusive teaching practices. Information about both the topics and the format of the group collaboration will be shared in advance; participants will be encouraged to select a single group for the afternoon.

  Submissions should follow the template provided below. Submissions will be reviewed for their relevance to the intended audience as well as breadth of topics across the event as a whole. The program committee may recommend that some submitters merge topics if overlapping submissions are received.

  ## **Submission Requirements**

  The program committee invites submissions following the provided templates indicating the information requested in a submission. All submissions may be made through email or GitHub pull request following the process described below. Submissions, and questions about submissions, can be sent to Jakob Barnard (Jakob.Barnard@uj.edu).

  1. **Morning Session (Pick one template):**
     - **Curricular Innovation Submissions:** A brief (1 to 2-page) description of a curricular innovation that reflects a specifically liberal arts philosophy. This may include full curriculum models, individual courses, outreach programs, co-curricular programs, or other interdisciplinary or liberal-arts-focused educational initiatives. Please see the template below. 
     - Submission Templates: 
       - Markdown:[ ](https://computing-in-the-liberal-arts.github.io/SIGCSE2024-Affiliated-Event/CurricularInnovationTemplate.html)[https://github.com/computing-in-the-liberal-arts/committee-templates/blob/main/docs/events/CurricularInnovationTemplate.md](https://github.com/computing-in-the-liberal-arts/committee-templates/blob/main/docs/events/CurricularInnovationTemplate.md)
