# An invitation to collaborate on a textbook for CS 1 and/or 2

Contributed by Jessen Havill (jessen.havill@bucknell.edu), Bucknell University

## Brief summary of topic

I am interested in initiating a collaboration with other interested CS 1/2 teachers from liberal arts colleges on a third edition of my CS 1 textbook *Discovering Computer Science,* and possibly an extension for CS 2.

I understand how this might strike the reader as nothing more than a self-interested and cheap way to get ideas for a new book.  However, that is most definitely not my intent.  Rather I am genuinely interested in moving this project toward a collaborative effort made richer by a wide variety of perspectives and expertise, leading to a resource that is valuable to more of us who teach computing to a diverse set of students in a liberal arts environment.

### Background

About 12 years ago, after having taught introductory CS classes for almost 20 years, I started developing my own approach to CS 1.  I had become increasingly uncomfortable with the de facto way that introductory programming was taught---syntax first followed by contrived examples with little attempt to relate the power of computational thinking to a broad audience.  In place of this sterile, deductive approach, I wanted to create an inductive, problem-based approach that connected computational problem solving to topics  students were already interested in or studying in other classes.  Long story short, [*Discovering Computer Science: Interdisciplinary Problems, Principles, and Python Programming*](http://www.discoveringcs.net), now in its second edition, was born.

It has now been four years since the second edition was published, and I have been asked by the publisher to consider a third edition.  

### Moving forward

Although I do have some ideas of what I might change in a third edition, I am interested in taking the project in a fresh direction with the help of interested members of the liberal arts computer science community.  I am fully open to contributions ranging from small suggestions to full co-authorship.  

I am not necessarily interested in this session in hashing out what particular programming topics should be in such a book.  (That can come later.)  Instead, I'd like to brainstorm about the story that we want to tell incoming college students, both CS majors and others, about computational problem solving, its power, and the responsibilities that come with it.  I think that the problem solving and Python programming aspects of the book are in a decent place (but I'm always open to improvements).  However, I think there are opportunities to weave in additional topics and connect the content more robustly to the modern world.  There are others in our community who have more expertise in these areas than I do.

Here are some of the questions I would propose we discuss, as a starting point:

- What gives a textbook value in our liberal arts context (vs. only lecture notes, a language reference, and/or online resources)?
- How might a CS 1 textbook for use at a liberal arts college be different than a traditional CS 1 book?  What is special about our environments and our students that we should be leveraging?
- What other liberal arts skills should a CS 1 textbook emphasize (e.g., writing, critical thinking)?
- Should we be teaching language independent problem solving techniques before programming in a particular language?
- Should a textbook include human-focused issues like accessibility, interface design, ethics, fairness, social impacts, etc.?
- What is the ideal textbook format?  Online with embedded interpreter?  Accompanying videos?  Accompanying system with auto-graded exercises?  Included active learning ideas?
- How should the book treat AI?
- Would it be beneficial to also create a CS 2 (data structures) book (presumably also in Python) that serves as a continuation of this approach?
- What should it cost students, if anything?

I would be very happy to incorporate other topics offered by participants.

## Description of session structure

I would begin the session by asking participants to introduce themselves and their current experience teaching CS 1 and 2.  I would also ask if they have any initial thoughts on their ideal textbook or class materials for CS 1.  Then I would provide a very short overview of the existing textbook, and share a full pdf with the participants.  Next I would invite comments and open the discussion with one of the questions posed above.  Ideally, the discussion would evolve naturally from that point, with me bringing it back on topic as needed.  I, or another participant, will keep notes on a shared google doc.

## Space or resource considerations

It would be helpful for participants to have a laptop to contribute to the shared notes during the discussion, but not required.

## Ideal Audience for Session

The ideal audience would be computing faculty at liberal arts schools who regularly teach CS 1 and/or CS 2.

## Intended Outcomes or Products

The immediate product would be a document with the group's ideas for a textbook revision.  The ideal ultimate product would be a new textbook for CS 1 and/or CS 2 that would be beneficial to faculty and students at liberal arts colleges.
