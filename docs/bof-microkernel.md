# Birds of a Feather (BoF) Session

Materials from the [SIGCSE 2025 Affiliated event](https://computing-in-the-liberal-arts.github.io/SIGCSE2025-Affiliated-Event/) are on the main page. This page is for notes from a related activity at SIGCSE 2025.  

Consolidated notes for the Bof Session entitled: Towards a Computer Science Curriculum "Microkernel"

BoF group notes "Defining the Liberal Arts and/or Liberal Arts Computer Science":

Why is this a top priority for the committee:

- We want to prepare students to have impact in a technically advanced world that is occupied by humans, communities and cultures.
- Creators need to:
  - Think about “should we” not just “can we”.
  - Understand that users are people.
  - Do more than implement specifications.
  - Embody a civic engagement mindset.
  - Recognize that technology is an amplifier.
  - Approach their work ethically and with humility (avoid “White Knighting”)
  - Anticipate and mitigate unintended consequences.

What can the committee or we as a community do to catalyze this work:

- Be intentional about teaching and communicating to students why the above items are a priority for their learning as a liberally educated technologist / Computer Scientist.
- Create / Curate / Disseminate materials that:
  - Infuse this type of thinking across the curriculum.
    - E.g. The Embedded Ethics materials from Harvard
  - Add real world issues and context to examples and projects.
    - E.g. Not compute the average of a list, but find the average water height in a reservoir in different years.
- Facilitate dissemination and adoption of existing materials through:
  - Collection of existing materials.
  - Collection of existing practices.
    - E.g. Team teaching, interdisciplinary courses.
  - Workshops, support groups, peer mentors, ambassadors.
  - Panels

Who should be engaged in this work:

- Important to build support with institutional administration
  - Secure backing and reassurance for “risky” curricular initiatives.
    - They may not work. 
    - They may not be popular resulting in not great student evals, which presents a particular risk for more junior faculty.
  - Lower barriers to interdisciplinary collaboration. 
    - For example teaching credit assignments that encourage interdisciplinary, team teaching, guest lectures, etc.
