## Unconference Session Details

**Unconference on Liberal Arts CS Education** (4:15 PM - 6:00 PM)

During this unconference session, participants will be invited to join a group for structured discussion or collaborative work designed to lead to a particular outcome or product. This might include structured notes on a topic, a collection of resources, a position statement, or plans for an on-going working group.

A preliminary list of [proposed unconference sessions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V1TejkXV9rHUexTZ6aUXkjH0eHq0bjqfgyIXL4AzCPM/edit?usp=sharing) will be available for review prior to the event. Additions to this list will be accepted up until the time of the event and will also be solicited at the end of the morning session. Information on submitting unconference session suggestions is available in our [Call for Submissions](https://computing-in-the-liberal-arts.github.io/SIGCSE2026-Affiliated-Event/2026CallForParticipation.html) or can be sent via email to Jakob Barnard ([Jakob.Barnard@uj.edu](mailto:Jakob.Barnard@uj.edu))

**Selection of Unconference Sessions**

Unconference session sponsors will briefly present their proposed topic including the desired outcomes or products from their session and plans for organizing the discussion or collaborative work. Participants will indicate interest in various sessions and a set will be selected to proceed for the rest of the afternoon. Participants will select groups to join.

**Unconference Sessions**

Selected sessions will gather and session leaders will follow their provided plan for the allotted time. An announcement will be made encouraging groups to take a break at the midpoint of the session, but individual sessions will have flexibility to divide up this time in the manner that best suits their topic and intended collaboration.

Event organizers will collect links to content created in each session and add them to the event website.

**Debrief and Open Discussion**

Session leaders will briefly share the results of their session and plans, if any, for future collaboration. Participants will have the opportunity for informal discussion across groups. Additional suggestions of Committee priorities for the coming year will be collected.
