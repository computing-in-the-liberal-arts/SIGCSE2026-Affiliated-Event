## Brief summary of topic
As artificial intelligence (AI) has increasingly entered into many different disciplines, students from all majors in a liberal arts college need the skills to use the technology effectively. Current and incoming students have access to generative AI such as ChatGPT and Grammarly and are likely already using these technologies. There is simultaneously an inherent tension between this technology and faculty who may refuse to integrate AI into their classroom seeing it as a threat to students ability to develop critical thinking. However, this active refusal could be a disservice to the students whose lives require a deeper understanding of how generative AI works and to use it effectively. Computer science faculty familiar with this technology are in the best place to help their colleagues better understand AI's benefits and limitations and reframe the issue of AI from a threat to a intentional companion in the learning process. Further, we can collaborate with faculty who teach in writing intensive courses to create learning modules to integrate AI use rather than reliance into the assignments. This process would firmly place computer science within general education alongside other important skills such as reading/writing and math ability.
In conjunction with this effort, there needs to be the academic administration can be included in supporting an initiative to create a support group to discuss best practices and enhance how faculty apply these modules. Without administrative support, initiatives like this cannot start and grow to keep up with the evolving technology and understanding of its use. Further, teaching students to stay relevant in the world and be designers and leaders could reignite interest in post secondary education and allow liberal arts colleges to be appealing to future students and their families. 

## Description of session structure
Breakout into two large groups, one which can focus on ideas or developed modules that can be inserted into writing intensive/research courses in the general education core courses.

The second group will focus on topics/issues that they have heard are hurdles for faculty to include/adopt AI into their activities and assignments.

(1 hour 20 minutes): Using the carousel style of ideation, each large group will break into groups of 3 in which each group will have large sticky note with a question. The sticky boards will rotate around as people add their ideas on smaller notes.
- (5-10 minutes) Organize
- (10 minutes) Participants at their group will discuss the question and add their ideas/notes on stick notes (not writing on the larger board)
- Rotate
- (15 minutes) Participants will look at the ideas on their new sticky and organize/add their own ideas. If someone agrees with a note already on the sticky, they would put a "+" to indicate support.
- Rotate
- (15 minutes) Participants will again look at the idea sticky.
- Rotate
- (10 minutes) Participants will discuss what they have discovered and remove/organize/add their new ideas to their sticky
- (15 minutes) Each table will report out top idea from their sticky.
(1 hour 10 minutes)
Each large group will discuss the ideas and start to outline either modules or discussion points for integrating AI into general education courses. These lists and ideas will be shared to the community.

## Space or resource considerations
As an ideation session, sticky notes, large pads, and pens are necessary, but I can bring those. Laptops may be used to take notes or in designing talking points or modules, but this work must be shared with the facilitator to share with the community.

## Ideal Audience for Session

Administrators of liberal arts colleges that see the need to fully integrate AI into general education. Any faculty who are worried about students being able to thrive in an AI-existing world and feel that such discernment is critical for student success.

## Intended Outcomes or Products
_What artifacts will be able to be shared with the community?
These will be linked to through the committee webspace._

All the notes and questions and module drafts and talking points will be shared to the community.
