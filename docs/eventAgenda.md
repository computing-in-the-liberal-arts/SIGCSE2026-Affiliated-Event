* **Breakout Discussions** (11:15 AM - 11:45 PM)

  ​	Morning session presenters will host discussion tables for continued in-depth conversation about their curricular and instructional innovations. We will also host one or more “Connect with Colleagues” tables for those who are interested in less structured discussion and networking.

* **Soliciting Committee Priorities and Unconference Topics** (11:45-12:15)

  ​	We will close the morning by asking participants to reflect on what priorities they would like to see the Committee take up in the coming year and what topics they would like to see explored in more depth during the afternoon Unconference session.

* **Lunch Break** (12:15 PM - 2:00 PM)

* **Afternoon Session: Unconference on Liberal Arts CS Education**
  (2:00 PM - 5:00 PM)

  ​	During this unconference session, participants will be invited to join a group for structured discussion or collaborative work designed to lead to a particular outcome or product. This might include structured notes on a topic, a collection of resources, a position statement, or plans for an on-going working group.

  ​	A [preliminary list of proposed unconference sessions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OtyQzXVxWzZsPerdMZucCCEtQvLSnyeX8tsiCOMYh1A/edit?usp=sharing) is available for review. Additions to this list will be accepted up until the time of the event and will also be solicited at the end of the morning session. Information on submitting unconference session suggestions is available in our [Call for Submissions](https://computing-in-the-liberal-arts.github.io/SIGCSE2025-Affiliated-Event/2025CallForParticipation.html) or can be sent via email to Jakob Barnard ([Jakob.Barnard@uj.edu](mailto:Jakob.Barnard@uj.edu))

  ​	Upon return from lunch, attendees interact with session organizers and indicate interest in various sessions and a set will be chosen to proceed for the remainder of the afternoon.

* **Selection of Unconference Sessions** (2:00 PM - 2:30 PM)

  ​	Unconference session sponsors will briefly present their proposed topic including the desired outcomes or products from their session and plans for organizing the discussion or collaborative work. Participants will select groups to join for the afternoon.

  - Submitted session: [Bucknell](https://github.com/computing-in-the-liberal-arts/SIGCSE2025-Affiliated-Event/blob/main/docs/unconference/bucknell-session.md)

* **Unconference Sessions** (2:30 PM - 4:30 PM)

  ​	Selected sessions will gather and session leaders will follow their provided plan for the allotted time. An announcement will be made encouraging groups to take a break at the midpoint of the session, but individual sessions will have flexibility to divide up this time in the manner that best suits their topic and intended collaboration.

  ​	Event organizers will collect links to content created in each session and add them to the event website.

* **Debrief and Open Discussion** (4:30 PM - 5:00 PM)

  ​	Session leaders will briefly share the results of their session and plans, if any, for future collaboration. Participants will have the opportunity for informal discussion across groups. Additional suggestions of Committee priorities for the coming year will be collected.
